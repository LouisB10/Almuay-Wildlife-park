Amuay Wildlife Park is a nature reserve situated 350 km west of the Venezuelan capital. The park's
wide range of animal and plant life extends over 72 km2 through varying grassland, hills, and
marshes. The Venezuelan government prohibits vehicular traffic through the area, other than by
scheduled tours along specified dirt tracks, to protect the landscape, to protect visitors, and to
